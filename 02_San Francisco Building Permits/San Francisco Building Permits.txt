Kaggle – Handling Missing Values (Short Explanation)

This exercise teaches how to detect and handle missing (null/NaN) values in datasets before building ML models.

Main Idea

Real-world data often has missing values → you must clean or fill them so models work properly.

Key Methods Used
1. Remove Missing Data

Drop rows/columns with missing values (dropna()).

Simple but may lose useful data and reduce dataset size.

2. Imputation (Fill Missing Values)

Replace missing values with estimated values:

Mean / Median / Mode

Keeps dataset size but may slightly distort data.

3. Forward / Backward Fill

Use previous value (ffill) or next value (bfill).

Useful for ordered or time-series data.

4. Interpolation (advanced)

Estimate value based on pattern/trend of nearby data.

Why This Matters

Handling missing values properly:

Improves data quality

Improves model accuracy

Prevents bias and errors in analysis

In Simple

This Kaggle exercise shows how to:

Detect missing values

Decide whether to drop or fill them

Use basic imputation techniques

Prepare clean data for machine learning
