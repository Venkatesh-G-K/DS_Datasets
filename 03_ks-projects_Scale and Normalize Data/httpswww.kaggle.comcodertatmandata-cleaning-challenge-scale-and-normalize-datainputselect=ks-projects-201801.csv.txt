Kaggle – Scaling and Normalization (Short Explanation)

This exercise teaches how to adjust numerical data values so machine learning models perform better.

Main Concept

Many ML algorithms work best when numbers are in a similar range or distribution.
Scaling/Normalization helps make features comparable and stable.

Techniques Covered
1. Scaling (Min-Max Scaling)

Rescales values to a fixed range [0, 1].

Formula:

𝑥
′
=
𝑥
−
𝑚
𝑖
𝑛
𝑚
𝑎
𝑥
−
𝑚
𝑖
𝑛
x
′
=
max−min
x−min
	​


Keeps shape of data, only changes range.

Useful for distance-based models (KNN, SVM, Neural Networks).

2. Standardization (Z-Score Scaling)

Centers data around mean = 0 and std = 1.

Formula:

𝑥
′
=
𝑥
−
𝜇
𝜎
x
′
=
σ
x−μ
	​


Works well when data follows normal distribution.

3. Normalization (Log Transform)

Used when data is skewed (not symmetric).

Log transform reduces large values and makes distribution more normal.

Example: np.log(column).

Why Important

Prevents one feature from dominating others

Speeds up model training

Improves accuracy and convergence

Required for many ML algorithms
